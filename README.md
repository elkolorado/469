# 469 (2001)

469 is a language found in Tibia. Created in 2001, it's about 21 years old and still have not been solved.  
469 is spoken between bonelords, a blob with 5 eyes. This is performed by blinking numbers.

Excerpt from a book in Tibia: [Beware of the Bonelords](https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/Beware_of_the_Bonelords_(Book))  

> The bonelords are an ancient race of underground dwelling necromancers. Although they can 'speak' like humans using some membranes, their native 'tongue' consists of a blinking code with each eye, where a blinking could mean some syllable, letter or word. It is by far the most complex speech we have ever encountered and it is almost impossible to comprehend. As far as we can tell it is not only a language but also some kind of mathematics. This combination makes it tedious even to try to understand that language.  
> The books the bonelords write contain only numbers and the code behind them is incredibly complex. This race was one of those which were part in the creation wars and therefore its peak of civilization and power is long gone. There are rumours about still existent bonelord settlements where they try to improve their unspeakable necromantic rituals and create an army of undead.

The main city of the current bonelords, Hellgate - contains a library holding 70 books, all in numbers. There are is 1 additional book in Ferumbras Citadel (probably stolen), and also copy of a book that exist in Hellgate in the Isle of The Kings. See all 71 books [here](01-books.md) where each line contains one book.  
Here we meet A Wrinkled Bonelord, the librarian. We can talk to it to get more information.

Here I have collected all clues I think we need to solve 469.

I start off by showing you what we can find in-game, and further down I will show you some of my thoughts.

- 01-books.md contains the books we find on 469.

> Player: books  
> a wrinkled bonelord: Our books are written in 469, of course you can't understand them.

> Player: 469  
> a wrinkled bonelord: The language of my kind. Superior to any other language and only to be spoken by entities with enough eyes to blink it.

> Player: language  
> a wrinkled bonelord: Our language is beyond comprehension by your lesser beings. It heavily relies on mathemagic. Your brain is not suited for the mathemagical processing necessary to understand our language.To decipher even our most basic texts, it would need a genius that can calculate numbers within seconds in his brain.

> Player: numbers  
> a wrinkled bonelord: Numbers are essential. They are the secret behind the scenes. If you are a master of mathematics you are a master over life and death.

> Player: name  
> a wrinkled bonelord: I'm 486486 and NOT 'Blinky' as some people called me ... before they died. So don't ... confuse your numbers, as my kind says.

> Player: Tibia  
> a wrinkled bonelord: It's 1, not 'Tibia', silly.

> Player: 0  
> a wrinkled bonelord: Go and wash your eyes for using this obscene number!

> Player: bonelord  
> a wrinkled bonelord: Our race is very old. Over the time, we have been given many different names by other races. The term bonelord sticks to us for quite a while now. In our language the name of our race is not fix but a complex formula, and as such it always changes for the subjective viewer.

## Demona & honeminas formula (2001)

Warlocks of Demona had a formulae for understanding the magic web '[honeminas](https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Honeminas_Formula_(Book))'.

```
(Note: g stands for gate, g [a_,x_] for the coordinates of the gate in the 2-dimensional-area and e for the strengh of the magic energy that flows into this gate.

For all other formulas look in your collection of formulas)

g[a_,x_] := a g[3,2] + (4,3,1,5,3).(3,4,7,8,4)

There are more formulae in [Demona Library](https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/Demona_Library)


## Paradox Tower Quest (2002)
Mathemagic is used in Paradox tower quest. In this quest we learn the secrets of mathmagics by the mad mage.  
Paradox tower also contain a direct teleport to Hellgate.

Mathemagic equations given at random (player will see at random any of 4) by a npc Riddler (which transcripts reference to Monthy Python movie):

>So know that everything is based on the simple fact that:
```
1 + 1 = 1  
1 + 1 = 13  
1 + 1 = 49  
1 + 1 = 94  
```
There is also a mirrored room in paradox tower of 469s creator, this room contains books that *could* be the cipher for 469.

## [The Black Knight's Last Moments of Sanity (2002)](https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Black_Knight's_Last_Moments_of_Sanity_(Book))  

```
I hate all humans! I will build a home and stay underground forever, they don't deserve my return!

The Bonelords are my only friends. They respect me. I belong to them now. In my dreams they have shown me the path to this underground base. When I sleep I can hear them whispering in my mind promises about eternal existence and immortality. My friends can feel my hunger for revenge on humanity and will supply me with the means to punish them and all living beings.
Never again I will wear that fancy armor and black shall be the color of my revenge.

## [Black Knight Gives Up on Humans (2002)](https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Knight_Gives_Up_on_Humans_(Book))  

```
There is a whole family of those Bonelords here. They do not seem to mind me..
I often have strange dreams in which those creatures talk to me using their eyes. But those are only nightmares for sure.

I found a small underground stream where I can get water from, so I can survive down here.

I've given up hope for my men to come looking for me. Pah, humans.. they are probably not even thinking about me anymore.

## [Ancient Races (2003)](https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/Ancient_Races_(Book))  
```
Some of the ancient races that rose and decayed during the wars of the gods were incredible powerful compared to modern mankind. Only tales of surviving ancients tell us about this people. There were races like the S'vir who travelled the sky in their cloud ships; beings like the elephant men, their name is long forgotten, whose ordinary speech were words of magic that formed reality around them. Then there were the Tur'osk'ahar which are remembered for creating runes as big as a ship; or the unnamed race that tamed and mastered the forces of ice and coldness to serve them; not to forget, the ancestors of the modern bonelords who could raise whole armies of undead in a blink and summon abominations of decay and bones as huge as a house. Some of the modern races had ancestors which were far more powerful than their kin today. As the war continued and the bitterness grew, less and less races were able to raise to greatness: It is said that humans and orcs were the least and the last of the races created.

## [Beware of the Bonelords (2003)](https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/Beware_of_the_Bonelords_(Book))  
```
Beware of the bonelords!
The bonelords are an ancient race of underground dwelling necromancers. Although they can 'speak' like humans using some membranes, their native 'tongue' consists of a blinking code with each eye, where a blinking could mean some syllable, letter or word. It is by far the most complex speech we have ever encountered and it is almost impossible to comprehend. As far as we can tell it is not only a language but also some kind of mathematics. This combination makes it tedious even to try to understand that language.
The books the bonelords write contain only numbers and the code behind them is incredibly complex. This race was one of those which were part in the creation wars and therefore its peak of civilization and power is long gone. There are rumours about still existent bonelord settlements where they try to improve their unspeakable necromantic rituals and create an army of undead.
In general they seem malicious but without any ambition to do more than to claim some lairs and to defend them. They seem to have no ambitions in conquering or allying with other races in a bigger style other than bonelord mercenaries who occasionally join forces with other entities for private reasons.

## [You Cannot Even Imagine (2003)](https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/You_Cannot_Even_Imagine_(Book))  

```
You can not even imagine how old I am. In your wildest dreams you won't see the things I have seen. I am the last of my race and even though I am several centuries old I am not immortal and will eventually die. I fear that day. Not for me - I am weary and I don't care much about if I'm alive or dead. But I fear for all these memories that will die with me. For all those who no one will remember anymore.
Words can't truly preserve their essence so I will leave no books or stone tablets. If I die, everything I have witnessed will die with me as if it has never existed. I was there when Rorak slew Tingil at the stairs of the seven temples. I was there as Riik led his peaceloving people to the far north to find refuge from the war. I was there to witness the betrayal of Asric for the whims of a female that was long dead by then. I fought with the last Frdai a futile battle on the plains of Weskurt against the unseen legion. I witnessed Ss'rar making his move on ascension to become the serpent god. I watched the first elves struggling to form a nation with the help of the lightbearers. It was me who assisted the great calculator to assemble the bonelords language. And you come here to this mountain and ask me how to win the heart of some shepherdess? This world has become a ridiculous mockery.
```



> It was me who assisted the great calculator to assemble the bonelords language.

Notice, '*the* great calculator' is a being rather than machine. (a wrinkled bonelord?)  
The person writing that book is thought to be the mad mage, who teaches us mathmagics, who created the paradox tower which has a direct teleport to Hellgate.

## [Braindeath lore (2007)](https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/Braindeath)
```
Some of the most ancient bonelords have gained so much power over undeath that they cross the margin between life and death. What might be considered the transformation of a living being into one of the dreaded liches, turns into something very sinister. Neither alive nor truly dead, they dwell on the border of two realms. Having mastered unspeakable techniques and twisted their own minds in ways unfathomable for other beings, they 'broke' something in their minds or rather in their souls. The part that connects each and everything to the living world is not working right in these creatures. At this step other creatures would just turn mad or wither, but some of the ancient bonelords face another fate. Through sheer will and unthinkable understanding of the thin lines between life and death, they grasp to the concept of existence. Just like they once animated their undead minions, they now keep their decaying but not really dead bodies in motion. Parts of their twisted minds are forever trapped in the realm of the dead though, captured in a constant nightmare that slowly tries to erode their sanity. To prevent the drifting off in this dream of death, they have removed parts of their skull. This way they are able to constantly stimulate their own brains with jolts of energy from their eye stalks. In a magical surgery, they have added an eye-stalklike appendage and attached a stinger to their body. It is used to leech brain fluids from helpless victims to sustain their own existence. Their central eye is sealed shut to prevent any unnecessary distraction from their inward struggle. As the central eye is normally used for bonelord communication, the Braindeath has no way to communicate with other bonelords. It relies on verbal communication which makes it disgusting even for its own kind.
Their mastery of death makes them formidable opponents. Luckily, they do not often meddle with the affairs of the living. Those who for some reason cross the path of a Braindeath should be prepared for a tough fight. With little regard for its own life or that of any other being, the Braindeath will attack with an array of devastating powers that outshines every other bonelord. Commanding powerful minions from beyond the grave and possessing the resilience of undeath, a Braindeath is a nearly unstoppable force if not countered with the correct tactics.

```
The Bonelord Threat I
Once in the olden days, the bonelords numbered among the most powerful races of the world. Their mighty cities, which characteristically contained ominous dark pyramids, could be found all over the world. The bonelords erected them using the same innate form of telekinesis which lets their bodies float in the air. However, they could not do completely without hands and arms that did their bidding. For this reason they relied on another innate power of their race - the dark power of necromancy. Thanks to the magical abilities of their tentacles, which are capable of producing various powerful kinds of magic to an extent that is denied to other races unless they study for many decades, the bonelords also knew how to command the dead. As a result, they used a monstrous strategy: Whenever they conquered an area they turned their unfortunate victims into undead slaves. Using these undead legions as their shock troops, the bonelords went from victory to victory. They built a huge fortress that served as their power base, and from there they went to conquer the world.
```

## [The Bonelord Threat II (2007)](https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Bonelord_Threat_II_(Book))  

```
The Bonelord Threat II It seemed like the bonelords, which were created by the gods as a counterweight to another race that preceded them in the god wars, were unstoppable. But, alas! In the end, they shared the same fate that most other races suffered during the god wars: Yet another race appeared on the scene which proved to be even mightier. They were well protected against the bonelords' magical arsenal, and so it was only a question of time before the bonelords' empire collapsed. The bonelords were replaced by a succession of other races that were chosen by the dark gods to champion their cause. One race followed another, sometimes even before the previous race had become extinct. All the while, the bonelords fared better than most of their successors: Owing to the fact that they had once conquered the whole world, small areas of their civilisation remained even while their once mighty cities disappeared and their mysterious pyramids crumbled to dust. Many bonelords chose to hide below the surface of the world, fighting fierce underground wars to win supremacy over the other races that had fled the surface where the god wars raged on. Their successes were limited, but at least the bonelords managed to establish a number of new subterranean bases, which were safe even though they lacked the grandeur of the bonelords former cities. The bonelords had learnt the bitter lessons from the gruesome wars that had led them to the brink of extinction. They had realised the limitations of their race, and they decided to work on their weaknesses. They found that they had relied too heavily on their intuitive powers in the past, and they decided to improve their innate powers through research and experiments. The dark art of necromancy seemed especially promising, so a group of bonelords concentrated all their efforts towards improving their powers to master the undead.
```

## [The Bonelord Threat III (2007)](https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Bonelords_Threat_III_(Book)) 
```
The Bonelords Threat III These efforts met with a first, important success when the bonelords managed to create a new kind of undead minion that was capable of acting on its own, without direct control by a bone master. Unfortunately, these minions still lacked intelligence, and although they were unwaveringly loyal they were of little use to their vile masters. And so it came that the bonelords continued their horrible experiments on living and dead ... They stole souls and implanted them, they switched minds and bodies between the dead and the living, but none of the gruesome experiments ever produced the kind of monstrosity they had in mind. Eventually they started exposing undead bodies to evil energies and merging them with living beings into massive undead monstrosities, which, however, withered and died almost as soon as they were created. After some experiments that failed in an particularly spectacular manner, the bonelords were forced to abandon their experiments. Soon, their gruesome experiments faded from memory. They had been all but forgotten when a number of braindeath emerged in a remote bonelord city, claiming to have achieved a decisive breakthrough in the field of necromancy. The high council of the bonelord elders reluctantly sent a number of scientists down to the laboratories to examine the results. The undead creatures they found were so hideous and degenerated that the scientists flatly declared that these experiments that led their creation contradicted the very principles of the bonelord race. All undead were to be destroyed and the experiments were to be abolished once and for all. The braindeaths, whose own minds had suffered considerably through years of isolation and of unholy experiments, were enraged by this decision. They openly defied the scientists and even the high council. When the elders issued an ultimatum and threatened to destroy the undead by force, the braindeaths rebelled. A war ensued that was short, but vicious. Both sides fought without mercy, using any weapon at their disposal. The braindeaths were eventually overwhelmed and killed, but not without unleashing their undead menagerie. The bonelords pursued them without mercy, but some of the undead, who were well capable of sentient thinking, escaped by blending in with the regular undead that employed in the city. Today, it is impossible to work out how many of those creatures escaped. However, it is safe to say that the powers they reportedly possessed are strikingly similar to those that are characteristic for vampires. For this reason it is safe to say that at least one of those creatures must have managed to escape from its subterranean prison. The bonelords, however, destroyed the remaining laboratories. It is even said that the remaining scientists that had been sent to assess the braindeaths' experiments eventually asked to be executed, as their analyses had tainted their minds in a way that only bonelords could understand. Their requests were granted. They were collectively put to death, taking their knowledge about the vile experiments to their graves. Today, nothing but speculation remains.

>Player: hi  
>Dreadeye: Ah, a visitor to intimidate. Splendid!

> Player: intimidate  
> Dreadeye: An amusing question in its own, naive way. Let me put it this way: I have become an outcast, and am no longer free to move about my own city. ...  Dreadeye: However, despite their limitations, my kind still regard me as useful. I can do .. things they can't or won't do. So I am of value to them. ...
Dreadeye: I have gained magnificent insights into things lesser bonelords could only dream of at the price of losing touch with concepts common amongst my kin. An insignificant price to pay for the riches I have gained! ...
Dreadeye: This makes me valuable .. for the moment. They come to me in secrecy to ask for my guidance in their petty schemes. ...
Dreadeye: They need my genius for help and that makes them less inclined to get rid of me. If the incompetent fools mess up and things go horribly wrong then they have a scapegoat to blame - me. ...
Dreadeye: However, I am just biding my time. One of these days, they will come for me .. and I'll be gone.

>Player: City  
>Dreadeye: This city was built by enslaved corpses and souls. It oozes pain and despair. Just how my people like it. Sadly, it is only a pale memory of the past. ...
In ancient times our cities were symphonies of agony, choruses of lost souls. Ah, the marvels of long gone times. How pitiable, that we lack the resources to enslave your puny race to sculpt something as glorious as the cities of the past. ...
Dreadeye: But, our time will come again! We merely need to wait. When the time comes, we will be ready. ...
Dreadeye: All it needs is a well timed push in the right place, human, and we will retake our rightful place and the agonised screams of your kind will be music in our ears!

>Player: Telas  
>Dreadeye: He is a desperate fool, turning to me for guidance, for those who deal with us pay a high price - they serve us as undead slaves for eternity, muhaha! ...
Dreadeye: And a lucky fool for I have my reasons to oblige his request.

>Player: Bonelord  
Dreadeye: You only know my race from the remnants that are scattered through this world. These remnants are nothing when compared with those bonelords who grasped the world by its throat in the glorious days of our dominance! ...
Dreadeye: We were the rulers, the ultimate masters. Fate and the Gods betrayed us. Stole what was rightfully ours. But we have survived. We are still here. What once was ours will become ours again. ...
Dreadeye: We just have to wait. Patience is our power.

>Player: Yalahari  
>Dreadeye: A vain and elusive race. Powerful enough to defy the Gods... so they thought. Now their power is gone, their race declined. They exist still, broken, bereft of any true power. ...
Dreadeye: They are as good as dead. With our expertise in necromancy, we recognize the signs of death when we see them. Unlike us bonelords they will never rise again.

>Player: Necromancy  
>Dreadeye: What you understand under the term necromancy is only the tip of the iceberg compared to what we are doing, puny human. We are the masters of souls. ...
Dreadeye: Creators, shapers, masters. Ours is a complete realm beyond your understanding. Our knowledge borders the realms of apotheosis and it is only a matter of time until the final step is taken.

>Player: Apotheosis  
>Dreadeye: You could not hope to understand it anyway. But we were close. So close that the Gods struck down our empire and our race. But we survived. We are still here. And our time will come. You can't delay the inevitable.

>Player: Language  
>Dreadeye: Only true bonelords can understand our language. Even I in my... changed state have a hard time understanding even the simple parts of our writings and some parts of it are completely alien to me now. ...
Dreadeye: You, human, will never understand our language as you will never understand our ways.

## [Robson (2011)](https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/Robson)
>Robson: It seems there was once a building in the centre of the isle. The ruins are still there. Some of the pillars outside remind me of what I've seen in a bonelord hideout that we've raided when I was younger. ...
Robson: The rest of the ruins here, though, does not fit into that. Either the isle has been populated by different inhabitants, or by some race that I don't know at all. ...
Robson: Be it as it may, there has to be something about this isle that attracted inhabitants before me and I wonder what that might be. ...
Robson: I could not figure it out in all those years though. So I doubt anyone can do that during my lifetime.

>The First Dragon: I dictated my memoirs to a human servant. I like the idea to share my thoughts and memories with humanity with the help of a book. ... You are my greatest fans after all. ... If it becomes popular, I might consider an orcish translation or even one in bonelord language. ... By the way, it's a funny story how I learnt the bonelord language. However, I saved it for a possible part two of my memoirs.
